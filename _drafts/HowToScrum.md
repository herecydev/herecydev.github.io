# How To: SCRUM

Boy this is a mess in the software development world if ever I've seen one. SCRUM seems to be a magic word that people conjure up in an interview or to the suits. *Newsflash: It's not the 90s anymore!* Let's stop trying to impress people and start using it for what it is; a damn good software development methodology.

## I missed the memo, what is it? 

> * A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.
> * During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.
> * The team has a certain amount of time — a sprint (usually two to four weeks) — to complete its work, but it meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).
> * Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.
> * At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
> * The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
> * As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.

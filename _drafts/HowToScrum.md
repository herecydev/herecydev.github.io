# How To: Scrum

Boy this is a mess in the software development world if ever I've seen one. Scrum seems to be a magic word that people conjure up in an interview or to the suits. *Newsflash: It's not the 90s anymore!* Let's stop trying to impress people and start using it for what it is; a damn good development methodology. It's frustating how many people are lying about using Scrum. Let's clear the air on this...

## I missed the memo, what is it?

A whistle-stop tour:

> * A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.
> * During sprint planning, the team pulls a small chunk from the top of that wish list, a sprint backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.
> * The team has a certain amount of time — a sprint (usually two to four weeks) — to complete its work, but it meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).
> * Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.
> * At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
> * The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
> * As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.

So nothing too special there, right? Right! I can make it super simple:

* Product owner - Make a list of important things to you and prioritize it.
* Team - Decide on an appropriate amount of items that you can feasibly complete within the sprint and [Just do it!](https://youtu.be/nuHfVn_cfHU)
* Scrum master - Facilitate the team in accomplishing all of the items, ensuring that it gets delivered at the end of the sprint.

So why does every team think they are a boundary case? You've all heard this one, "we just work in a different way" or "we tried it and it didn't work". Something so incredibly simple cannot be that difficult to follow. Let's explore some of the common enemies of Scrum;

## "You need to be more reactive"
> The team don't react to high priorities; it's better when the team can switch to what's more important.

A product owner has a prioritized list of items that he/she wants to be completed by the team. Through being transparent, the team has let the product owner know what they will deliver at the end of the sprint. Often, people will seek to push their agenda as being the most important. Only with complete omnividence can you assess priority, and that's something the product owner is enlisted to do. The success of the sprint lies within the abstraction away from external influences; only through complete focus on the items at hand can a team be able to complete the sprint and deliver.

PSA for these kind of people: The display of arrogance by assuming you are more important than others is **egregious**. Work with the product owner to have your features developed in due course.

## Making priority, a.k.a. the hero developer
> He said it was important; I should do it immediately.

Interruptions and multitasking are bad for efficiency. You shouldn't feel any pressure to open your inbox or to vacate your work to appease someone. Feeling like the hero for assisting someone is great, but you've dropped the ball on your current goals; you've failed the product owner and the stakeholders. What's worse is that you set a precedent for this behavior; you've encouraged a free-for-all!

When committing to the sprint backlog, the team are ensuring that the *most important* pieces of work are delivered. That means

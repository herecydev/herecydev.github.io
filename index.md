#Don’t stagnate; distinguish. Musings from a “junior”.

Development is a craft, a marathon to perfection. Quality code will demand persistence and determination, but when the dust settles it’s the acclaimed piece that stands for years, embracing change with ease. Too often development is seen as a sprint; “it fulfilled the requirements…”. In this series I want to explore how to develop yourself and why.

You’re in that graduate position. Unaware of half the technologies required, lots of knowledge of C from that old professor only to find you’re doing C# now, and struggling to grasp half the acronyms and buzz words thrown about. But you’re keen to learn and who better to learn from than that senior developer who’s been there 15 years; he’s a legendary developer compared to you. But be objective for a second, is he actually good? 

What has he learnt recently? What has he done to better himself? Is he using the right patterns? He’s that great oak tree; his experience and wisdom is admirable but he doesn’t track the sun anymore and certainly doesn’t bend in the wind. Nothing is changing his ways. You’re the sapling, do you want to follow the tree or follow the sun and make your own path? Time to distinguish.

Before delving into useful techniques and patterns which will change the way you develop, let’s dig into the most important thing, mentality. Approaching the problem not with haste, but with a calm and a clear-mind. Stop rushing into coding, inevitably you will repeat the same (likely incorrect) pattern that you’ve done over and over. Instead, plan out how you can make the code flexible and modular, what each component will be trying to achieve and the right technologies you can leverage. Approaching these problems early on will set you on the right foot.

It’s common to face time pressures. In the eyes of the typical, bad manager “if you’re not writing code, you’re not working”. Don’t collapse under this pressure thinking you’re not being productive, persevere with planning until you feel comfortable with the direction you’re heading but don’t over analyze. Often, spiking a technical piece can eliminate the feeling of “I don’t know where to start” and gives you a platform for inspiration.
